This script analyzes linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay using genotyping data. It processes LD estimates, fits a nonlinear regression model, and calculates the recombination parameter (rho, 4Nr). The script then generates an LD decay plot, adjusting for chromosomal distances and identifying the half-decay distance, a key metric for understanding genetic linkage patterns.

Key Features:
Reads and processes TASSEL LD output.
Fits a nonlinear model to estimate recombination rates.
Computes LD decay curves and identifies the half-decay distance.
Visualizes LD decay using scatter plots and fitted curves.
